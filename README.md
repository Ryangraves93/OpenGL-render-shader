# OpenGL-render-shader
A tutorial series I followed to create a workflow with openGL to render primitives with a shader then began abstracting implementation. 
The series coverd -

* Writing basic fragment and pixel shaders in OpenGL
* Using OpenGL's workflow for vertex and index arrays
* Abstracting low-level function calls to more high-level classes
* Texturing 
* Projection matricies, and more specifically the model-view-projection matrix for rendering.
